Anomaly Detection of Credit Card

Project Overview

This Power BI-based project provides a comprehensive analysis of credit card transaction data to detect fraudulent activity. By leveraging data visualization techniques and anomaly detection algorithms, the dashboard offers a visual representation of key metrics, enabling financial institutions to identify suspicious transactions and protect customers.

Key Features

Transaction Analysis: Visualizes transaction amounts, balance changes, merchant activity, and payment types.
Anomaly Detection: Employs various anomaly detection techniques (e.g., statistical methods, machine learning algorithms) to identify unusual patterns.
Time Series Analysis: Analyzes transaction data over time to detect temporal anomalies or trends.
Geographic Analysis: Examines transaction locations to identify geographic anomalies or fraud hotspots.

Data Visualization Techniques

Charts:

Line charts: To visualize transaction amounts over time.
Bar charts: To compare transaction frequencies by merchant category.
Scatter plots: To identify relationships between transaction variables.
Maps: To visualize transaction locations and identify geographic anomalies.

Data Sources and Tools

Dataset: [Specify the source or nature of the dataset, e.g., credit card transaction data]
Tools: Microsoft Power BI

Usage

Data Preparation: Ensure the dataset is clean and formatted correctly for analysis.
Data Exploration: Use Power BI's built-in features to explore the data's characteristics and identify potential anomalies.
Visualization: Create visualizations using Power BI's charting capabilities to represent key metrics and trends.
Anomaly Detection: Apply appropriate anomaly detection techniques and algorithms to identify suspicious transactions.
Interpretation: Analyze the visualizations and anomalies to draw conclusions and take appropriate actions.

Future Enhancements

Machine Learning Models: Explore the use of advanced machine learning models for more sophisticated anomaly detection.
Real-time Monitoring: Implement real-time monitoring capabilities to detect fraud as it occurs.
Integration with Other Systems: Integrate the dashboard with other systems (e.g., fraud prevention systems, customer support) for seamless fraud management.

By leveraging this Power BI-based dashboard, financial institutions can proactively detect and prevent credit card fraud, protect their customers, and reduce financial losses.
